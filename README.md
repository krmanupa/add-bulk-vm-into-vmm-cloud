Add Bulk VM into VMM Cloud
==========================

            



 
This Script Adds any vm that is not bind to a cloud in the selected cloud. You need to change the VM name that I used like 'WAPLoad*' with your own VM name and also Change the VMM Cloud to the Cloud you are using.  The script is based on VM names that
 are created with a basic same VM prefix name else you need to create a different selection. The Script is showing basic steps and is easy to use for other scripts.




        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
